Color Picker
============

Here is provided a color dialog that is more user-friendly than the default
QColorDialog.

The main project file contains a simple application that just shows the dialog.
The subdirectory color_widgets contains the specialized widgets used in
Color_Dialog and they can be installed as a Qt Designer/Creator plugin.

You can see a screenshot of the dialog at
